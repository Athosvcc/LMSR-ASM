Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule apllied to Norman Ehrentreich's version of the Santa-Fe Institute Automatic Stock Market

TODO: Update model to the most recent Java and Repast versions.

Java version built by Norman Ehrenthreich, based on the Santa-Fe Institute Automatic Stock Market (SFI-ASM).
The model originally uses the Swarm library and Objective-C. Norman Ehrentreich ported it to Java using the Repast library.

In order to analyse dinamics in trading in Prediction Markets, I use a Liquitidy Sensitive Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LS-LMSR) as an Automated Market Maker (AMM)
